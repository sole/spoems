## getting it

### clone it

`git clone https://github.com/sole/spoems.git`

## initialising

Install node.js if not installed yet, then cd to the directory and run `npm init`.

To build the files into the `build` folder just do `npm start`. This will start a gulp script and it will watch for changes in the src folder and rebuild. Open `index.html` to see your thing in action, or better yet serve it with a local server.
