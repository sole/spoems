Weird Invention Improves Golf Scores by 10 to 20 Strokes

I recently opened the doors on a revolutionary new program,<br />
and it has already caused quite a stir.<br />
<br />
You see, I analyzed the swing of the most accurate golfer in<br />
the world &ndash; a shaft-testing robot owned by the True Temper<br />
golf company.<br />
<br />
This robot can hit every ball 325 yards, to an accuracy of within<br />
6 inches. It&rsquo;s flat out astonishing to see&hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and when I saw it for the first time, <b>I immediately realized<br />
what most of us golfers were doing wrong</b>:<br />
<br />
<u>We have too many moving parts in our swing. We end up with<br />
an inefficient (i.e. ineffective) swing because all those moving<br />
parts are working against each other</u>.<br />
<br />
And that's what I created my program to solve.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s called The MEGSA Method. MEGSA stands for Most Efficient<br />
Golf Swing Attainable&hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and it&rsquo;s going to give you exactly that.<br />
<br />
You know the key to being a great golfer, is accuracy and consistency.<br />
<br />
You want to know when you're standing over the ball that you're<br />
going to put it exactly where you want it, every time.<br />
<br />
But accuracy is hard. And consistency is even harder.<br />
<br />
That&rsquo;s where my system comes in.<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered what about your game makes<br />
consistency tougher than it needs to be, here's what I suggest...<br />
<br />
<strong><a>Check out  the history behind the MEGSA Method</a></strong> &mdash; the full<br />
story behind this laser-accurate robot, Iron Byron, and my <br />
incredible discovery about the physics of your swing.<br />
<br />
<strong><a>Then head over here for the full details of MEGSA Method,<br />
and see what all the fuss is about</a></strong><br />
<br />
&hellip; and hurry, because I&rsquo;ll even show you how you can try my<br />
system with no obligation.<br />
<br />
To always lower scores,<br />
